# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to cloud-itonami-isco-3142!

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloud-itonami/cloud-itonami-isco-3142.git
cd cloud-itonami-isco-3142
clojure -M:test
```

## Code Style

- All source code is `.cljc` (portable Clojure).
- Follow standard Clojure naming conventions.
- Tests are colocated with source files and use `clojure.test`.

## Testing

All pull requests must pass the full test suite:

```bash
clojure -M:test
```

## Safety-Critical Areas

This actor enforces hard invariants (technician/farm provenance, propose-only effects) and escalation rules (pest/disease risk, low confidence). Changes to `governor.cljc` and these invariants must be reviewed carefully.
